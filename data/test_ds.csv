I guess I just got lost
Being someone else
I tried to kill the pain
Nothin' ever helped
I left myself behind
Somewhere along the way
Hoping to come back around
To find myself someday
[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I'm so tired of waiting for you
To say that it's ok, but tell me
[Chorus]
Please, would you one time
Just let me be myself
So I can shine with my own light
Let me be myself
[Post-Chorus]
Would you let me be myself
[Verse 2]
I'll never find my heart
Behind someone else
I'll never see the light of day
Living in this cell
It's time to make my way
Into the world I knew
Take back all of these times
That I gave in to you
[Pre-Chorus]
Lately I'm so tired of waiting for you
To say that it's ok, but tell me
[Chorus 2]
Please, would you one time
Just let me be myself
So I can shine with my own light
Let me be myself
For a while, if you don't mind
Let me be myself
So I can shine with my own light
Let me be myself
[Bridge]
That's all I've ever wanted from this world
Is to let me be me
[Chorus]
Please, would you one time
Let me be myself
So I can shine with my own light
Let me be myself

Please, would you one time
Let me be myself

DMC, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive
Possible overdose, substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready
Respiration is eight
He's intubated and we're bagging him now
Uh, BP 90 over palp
Patient is cool, pale, and diaphoretic
Has aspirated,
uh, GSC is 3
Will update en route,
ETA: ten minutes
[Verse 1: Eminem]
As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene
To receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil, like, ""I think I'll just have a taste""
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium
Like, ""yeah, that's great""
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
""Mommy, something is wrong with Dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 Musketeers in the rear seat, weird""
[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't,
say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know
[Verse 2: Eminem]
""Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?""
That's the devil in my ear, I've been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fucking hear
""Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers""
""And maybe if I just drink half
I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time""
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
To have another half a glass of wine
Sounds asinine, yeah, I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm 'bout to fall
I miss the couch and down I go, lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck, am I hungover, and goddamn, I got a headache
Shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please stand by
[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't,
say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know
[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then (Ahhh!)
Couple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose Proof, so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve-noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
""Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax""
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Okay, so now ya see the reason how come he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it?
So you can lie to Hailie
I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby; good night, Alaina!
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn
[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do

I'm not sure if there's a point to this story
But I'm going to tell it again
So many other people try to tell the tale
Not one of them knows the end
[Verse 1]
It was a junk house in South Carolina
Held a boy the age of ten
Along with his older brother Billy
And their mother and her boyfriend
Who was a triple loser with some blue tattoos
That were given to him when he was young
And a drunk temper that was easy to lose
But thank God he didn't own a gun
[Verse 2]
Well, Billy woke up in the back of his truck
Took a minute to open his eyes
He took a peep into the back of the house
And found himself a big surprise
He didn't see his brother, but there was his mother
With her red-headed head in her hands
While the boyfriend had his gloves wrapped around an old priest
Trying to choke the man
[Verse 3]
Billy looked up from the window to the truck
Threw up, and had to struggle to stand
He saw that red-necked bastard with a hammer
Turn the priest into a shell of a man
The priest was putting up the fight of his life
But he was old and he was bound to lose
The boyfriend hit as hard as he could
And knocked the priest right down to his shoes
[Verse 4]
Well, now Billy knew but never actually met
The preacher lying there in the room
He heard himself say, ""That must be my daddy""
Then he knew what he was gonna do
Billy got up enough courage, took it up
And grabbed the first blunt thing he could find
It was a cold, glass bottle of milk
That got delivered every morning at nine
[Verse 5]
Billy broke in and saw the blood on the floor
And he turned around and put the lock on the door
He looked dead into the boyfriend's eye
His mother was a ghost, too upset to cry
Then he took a step toward the man on the ground
From his mouth trickled out a little audible sound
He heard the boyfriend shout, ""Get out!""
And Billy said, ""Not 'til I know what this is all about""
""Well, this preacher here was attacking your mama""
But Billy knew just who was starting the drama
So Billy took dead aim at his face
And smashed the bottle on the man who left his dad in disgrace
And the white milk dripped down with the blood
And the boyfriend fell down dead for good
Right next to the preacher who was gasping for air
And Billy shouted, ""Daddy, why'd you have to come back here?""
His mama reached behind the
sugar and honey
And pulled out an envelope filled with money
""Your daddy gave us this,"" she collapsed in tears
""He's been paying all the bills for years""
""Mama, let's put this body underneath the trees
And put daddy in the truck and head to Tennessee""
Just then his little brother came in
Holding the milk man's hat and a bottle of gin
[Bridge]
Singing; la la la la, la la la la, yeah

La la la, la la la...
La la la la, la la la la, yeah
La la la la, la la la la, yeah

La la la, la la la...
[Outro]
Well now you heard another side to the story
But you wanna know how it ends?
If you must know the truth about the tale
Go and ask the milkman",dark_gritty,4

With your pretty blondish hair
Eating a breakfast burrito
You seemed so neato
So we took the bus down to the pier
Down on the sand
By the metal detector man
We looked across the bay
As the dolphins swam away
We held hands
And just imagined
With tears in my eyes
You had to say goodbye
You had to go
You couldn't tell me why
You said something about you moving to Alaska
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever
I know you're gone and you can't come home
I'm so alone, but I'll never forget about you
Dear Elizabeth
I hope you're doing well
I think it's so awesome that you're out monitoring glacier patterns
In some remote part of Alaska where no one can get a hold of you
I thought I'd try anyway
I understand
So I bought a krugerrand
I'll wear you near my heart
We'll never be apart
Now the heavens will smile upon us
With tears in my eyes
You had to say goodbye
You had to go
You couldn't tell me why
You said something about you living on an iceberg
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever
I know you're gone and you can't come home
I'm so alone, but I'll never forget about you
Dear Elizabeth
Again, I hope you're doing really good
I haven't heard from you yet but...
Anyway, the weirdest thing - I met your identical twin sister Liz the other night at a party?
Wow she looks just like you!
It was so trippy
Anyway she said you miss me but not to try to get a hold of you because you're real busy
And the weirdest thing is I guess she's joining you on the expedition?
Wow that's totally cool!
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever
Dear Elizabeth and Liz
I hope you're doing well
Anyway, I was at the mall and I met your identical cousin Beth
I didn't even know they had identical cousins and it made me miss you even more
[Phone Rings]
Hello?
Er, hello is this Elizabeth?
Yes it is
Elizabeth, it's me Roger - from the beach!
Oh...oh did I say Elizabeth? I meant, um, it's Francine...hah
Oh...Francine?
Yeah, I'm watching their house while they're gone over in Europe
Europe? I thought they were in Alaska?
Oh did I say Ala...I said, meant Alaska. Yeah they're in Alaska
Whatever, Europe, Alaska it's the same. Well, anyway they're going to be changing
This phone number so you probably shouldn't call here any more ok? Ok bye
Oh man...

Kinda broke this evening, y'all, so all I got's five, I got five
[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint, like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty
And when it comes to getting another
stogie
Fools all kick in like Shinobi
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend
hit it Bit
Unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
‘Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb-da-dumb-dumb

Avoiding all the dick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land, like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff, and pass my bomb back

Bomb will make a niggy go
delirious, like Eddie Murphy

‘Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

grab your '40, let's get keyed

messin' with that Indo weed

it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack

I take sacks to the face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa to burn
Slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)
‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the
Joint
, stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P. O
I know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a
Fatty, but the Tanqueray straight had me

Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train

Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket

Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up

Hello, hello, hello
[Verse 1]
I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world
But its feeling just like every other morning before
Now I wonder what my life is going to mean if it's gone
The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour at that
I started staring at the passengers who're waving goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?
[Chorus]
But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
[Verse 2]
I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know
Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself
I started running but there's no where to run to
I sat down on the street and took a look at myself
Said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to
[Chorus]
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
[Verse 3]
It's gone, gone, baby its all gone
There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home
It was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you
Well its gone, gone, baby its all gone
There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you

My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool, glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal

Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone

Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont, slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me

Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""

And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down and now we're goin' in

It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world

Doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says, ""Amen and Hallelujah!""

I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth
[Verse 1: Scarface]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya
[Verse 2: Willie D]
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me
[Verse 3: Scarface]
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me
[Verse 4: Bushwick Bill]
This year, Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
'Til a lawman got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie!

Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day,
husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned twenty-four
Only been with one man,
what happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna,
way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie,
and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985, 1985
[Verse 2]
She's seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club,
Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand on a member of Duran Duran
Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows? (on the radio?)

On the radio was
Springsteen, Madonna,

She hates time, make it stop
When did Mötley Crüe become classic rock? (Classic rock)
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop, stop, STOP!

The elevator in the hotel lobby has a lazy door
The man inside is going to a hotel room
He jumped out right after seein' just the very sight of me
Decided he better hike it to the second floor

It's temporary, this place I'm in
I permanently won't do this again
My belongings scattered all across the hotel floor

I thought about you and a candy bar

I could hold you forever

Close my eyes and say
Love is a poor man's food
Don't prophesize

[Intro: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad,
I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you
Damn…",sad_melancholic,3

Kim
]
Come on, get out!
(
I can't! I'm scared!
)
I said get out, bitch! (
Let go of my hair! Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you! Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!
)
Fuck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
""Oh my God, I'm crackin' up"" Get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (
Yes
)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (
Yes!
)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (
No!
)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(
Oh my God!
)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah! Somebody help!""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!
[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on

Peggy, where you been at? Getting all this promo
When it comes to money, bet these niggas is a no-show
I've been out in Bed-Stuy, chilling with my feet up
Laughing at these SoundCloud niggas trying to be us
When I say us, bet, I don't mean no fucking crew
Peggy been a solo act since Looney Tunes and Goofy Troops
Catch me out in Barksdale, counting fettuccine
While you pussy crackers still trying to pass P.T
Ooh, I'm up in Brownsville, strapped with a Kimber
All you yuppie purses getting swiped like Tinder
Now I'm at the White House, looking for your President
Hop out the van, pointing guns at your residence
Ooh, I'm up in Queens now, showing y'all a body
Hoping that you pussy ass c******s try and find me
Chains on my body, looking like a rapper
Acting like a slave when I’m gunning for my masters, nigga

You didn't know me, but he knew me best

Throw me in the water

Knowing all the things you just escaped

Push me out to sea
On a little boat that you made out
Of the evergreen
That you helped your father cut away
Leave me on the tracks
To wait until the morning train arrives
Don't you dare look back
Walk away
Catch up with the sunrise

And this is dangerous

Wait until the snow covers me up
So I cannot move
So I'm just embedded in the frost
Then leave me in the rain
Wait until my clothes cling to my frame
Wipe away your tear stains
Thought you said you didn't feel pain

Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, ""Why, God?""
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
[Verse 4: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon

Roman, Roman, stop it, stop it
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad
You and this boy Slim Shady
What's going on? They'll lock you away
They'll put you in a jail cell, I promise

Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza

Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro

Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo

Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Come la scia di un'elica

Anzi si sentiva già felice

Sparks fly, it's like electricity
I might die, when I forget how to breathe
You get closer and there's nowhere
In this world I'd rather be
Time stops like everything around me is frozen
And nothing matters but these
Few moments when you open
My mind to things I've never seen
[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm kissin' you, my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I've been tryna find
Falls right into place, you're all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I'm kissin' you
When I'm kissin' you, it all starts makin' sense
And all the questions I've been askin' in my head
Like, ""Are you the one? Should I really trust?""
Crystal clear, it becomes when I'm kissin' you
[Verse 2]
Past loves, they never got very far
Walls up, make sure I guarded my heart
And I promised I wouldn't do this
'Til I knew it was right for me
But no one (No one)
No guy that I've met before
Could make me (Make me) feel so right and secure
And have you noticed I lose my focus
And the world around me disappears?

'Cause when I'm kissin' you, my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I've been tryna find

I've never felt nothing like this
You're making me open up
No point even tryin' to fight this
It kinda feels like it's love

And it's been forty days
I've tried forty ways
You will never quite leave your sins behind
They'll haunt you, taunt you until the day you die
You will never really go
You think about it much but you need to know how the story ends, so you sit around, even though you should just go!
Tell your friends what you have heard, show them all the lies unlearned
[Pre-Chorus]
And when you really go, you will really know you were never meant for Earth
What's it worth?
If we're going to break it down with any logic, it's absurd

And no matter where we go, we are not alone
When the silence turns to cries of ""Why?""
What a way to begin: we inherit sin
And nobody's going to quench your thirst when the well runs dry, the well runs dry
And nobody's going to hold your hand on the day you die
[Verse 2]
I've tasted seven sins, so they won't let me in
I knock knock knock until my knuckles are bruised and raw
Stuck in the middle with my blood in a puddle on the floor
We made our beds, we'll judge ourselves

And only then and there will we disappear to our final resting place
What a waste!
So many decent people at the gates

Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat

Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done

I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats

Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come

His father was a drinker
And his mother cried in bed
Folding John Wayne's t-shirts
When the swingset hit his head
The neighbors they adored him
For his humor and his conversation
Look underneath the house there
Find the few living things, rotting fast, in their sleep
Oh, the dead
Twenty-seven people
Even more, they were boys
With their cars, summer jobs
Oh my God
Are you one of them?
[Verse 2]
He dressed up like a clown for them
With his face paint white and red
And on his best behavior
In a dark room on the bed
He kissed them all
He'd kill ten thousand people
With a sleight of his hand
Running far, running fast to the dead
He took off all their clothes for them
He put a cloth on their lips
Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth

I am really just like him

One more night, ooh, ooh, ooh

I've been trying, ooh, so long to let you know
Let you know how I feel
And if I stumble, if I fall, just help me back
So I can make you see

Please give me one more night, give me one more night
One more night 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Helplessly hoping
Her harlequin hovers nearby
Awaiting a word
Gasping at glimpses
Of gentle true spirit
He runs, wishing he could fly
Only to trip at the sound of good-bye

Wordlessly watching
He waits by the window
And wonders
At the empty place inside
Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams
He worries
Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?
[Chorus]
They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are for each other

Stand by the stairway
You'll see something
Certain to tell you confusion has its cost
Love isn't lying
It's loose in a lady who lingers
Saying she is lost
And choking on hello

And then pray for the politicians freely; get an amen?

Lord what's wrong with the nation, erase em'
But if I could teach the world to be a thug just like me

Of the road, turn out the lights, get out, and look up at the sky
And I do this to remind me that I'm really really tiny
In the grand scheme of things and sometimes this terrifies me
But it's only really scary cause it makes me feel serene
In a way I never thought I'd be because I've never been
So grounded and so humbled and so one with everything
I am grounded, I am humbled, I am one with everything
Rock and roll is fun but if you ever hear someone
Say you are huge look at the moon, look at the stars, look at the sun
Look at the ocean and the desert and the mountains and the sky
Say I am just a speck of dust inside a giant's eye
I am just a speck of dust inside a giant's eye
When I saw
Geneviève
I really liked it when she said
What she said about the giant and the lemmings on the cliff
She said ""I like giants, especially girl giants
Cause all girls feel too big sometimes, regardless of their size""
When I go for a drive I like to pull off to the side
Of the road and run and jump into the ocean in my clothes
And I'm smaller than a poppyseed inside a great big bowl
And the ocean is a giant that can swallow me whole
So I swim for all salvation and I swim to save my soul
But my soul is just a whisper trapped inside a tornado
So I flip to my back and I float and I sing
I am grounded, I am humbled, I am one with everything
I am grounded, I am humbled, I am one with everything
So I talked to Geneviève and almost cried when she said
That the giant on the cliff wished that she was dead
And the lemmings on the cliff wished that they were dead
So the giant told the lemmings why they ought to live instead
And when she thought up all those reasons that they ought to live instead
It made her reconsider all the sad thoughts in her head
So thank you Geneviève, cause you take what is in your head
And you make things that are so beautiful and share them with your friends
We all become important when we realize our goal
Should be to figure out our role within the context of the whole
And yeah, rock and roll is fun but if you ever hear someone
Say you are huge look at the moon, look at the stars, look at the sun
Look at the ocean and the desert and the mountains and the sky
And say I am just a speck of dust inside a giant's eye
I am just a speck of dust inside a giant's eye
I am just a speck of dust inside a giant's eye

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

A win win, come again)

Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?

“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”
I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay. You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this—you’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)

I was taking a trip out to L.A.​
Tooling along in my Chevrolet
Tokin’ on a number and diggin' on the radio
Just as I crossed the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to go
Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
'Cause there wasn't a filling station in sight
So I just limped on down the shoulder on the rim
I went as far as I could, and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
Kind of a redneck-lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn
Well, I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one?
There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place except for him and me
He just looked disgusted and pointed toward the telephone
I called up a station down the road a ways
And he said he wasn't very busy today
And he could have someone there in just about 10 minutes or so
He said, ""Now, you just stay right where yer at!""
And I didn't bother to tell the darn fool
That I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go
I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in and said, ""Who owns this car
With the peace sign, and the mag wheels,
and four on the floor?
""
Well, he looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd just wait outside
So I laid a dollar on the bar and headed for the door
Just when I thought I'd get out of there with my skin
These five big dudes come strollin' in
With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth
And I was almost to the door, when the biggest one
Said, ""You tip your hat to this lady son!""
And when I did, all that hair fell out from underneath
Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In
Jackson Mississippi
on a Saturday night
Especially when there was
three of them
and only one of me
But they all started laughing, and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I better think of something pretty quick
So I just reached out and kicked ol' green teeth right in the knee
Now he let out a yell that'd curl your hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said, ""Watch him folks 'cause he's a thoroughly dangerous man!""
""You may not know it but this man is a spy
He's a undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan!""
He was still bent over holding on to his knee
But everybody else was looking and listening to me
And I laid it on thicker and heavier as I went
I said, ""Would you believe this man has gone as far
As tearing Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGovern for President""
""Well, he's a friend of them long haired hippy-type,
pinko fags
!
I bet you he's even got a commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage""
""He's a snake in the grass, I tell you guys
He may look dumb but that's just a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage""
They all started looking real suspicious at him
And he jumped up and said, ""Now just wait a minute Jim!
You know he's lying, I been living here all of my life!""
""I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage, you can call home and ask my wife!""
Then he started saying something 'bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy moving and hoping I didn't run out of luck
And when I hit the ground I was making tracks
And they were just taking my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty and jumped in and fired that mother up
Mario Andretti
would have be sure been proud
Of the way I was moving when I passed that crowd
Coming out the door and headed toward me in a trot
And I guess I should've gone ahead and run
But somehow I just couldn't resist the fun
Of chasing them all just once around the parking lot
Well, they headed for their car, but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
I was slinging gravel and putting a ton of dust in the air
I had them all out there stepping and fetching
Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catching
But I figured I had better go ahead and split before the cops got there
When I hit the road I was really wheeling
Had gravel flying and rubber squealing
And I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas
Well, I think I'm going to reroute my trip
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped
If I went to L.A. via Omaha",upbeat_fun,4

One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now, every day, we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals
Had my pencil, and plus, my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like, ""Freeze!"" We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's, and that's a no-no
[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Check it, a-one-two, a-one
""Two dope niggas in the Cadillac,"" they call us
Went from ""Player's Ball"" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say, ""Motherfuck that playin',"" they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day; niggas, they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all player-haters can bite me

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys, bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds
before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses,
passes getting throwed like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined,
but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother, James,
things changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know,
""Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick (Trick), and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now""

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from (""Ayy"")
Some nigga was saying something
Talking 'bout smoke something
""Hey, man, you remember me from school?"" ""No, not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I'd been going through the same things that he has
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck

It covered up my soul;
When I am not this hunchback that you see
I sleep beneath the golden hill
You who wish to conquer pain
You must learn, learn to serve me well
You strike my side by accident
As you go down for your gold
The cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold;
He does not ask for your company
Not at the centre, the centre of the world
When I am on a pedestal
You did not raise me there
Your laws do not compel me
To kneel grotesque and bare
I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare
You who wish to conquer pain
You must learn what makes me kind;
The crumbs of love that you offer me
They're the crumbs I've left behind
Your pain is no credential here
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound
I have begun to long for you

I have begun to ask for you

It's run by a Greek
And he keeps good things to eat
But you should hear him speak!
When you ask him anything, he never answers ""no""
He just ""yes""es you to death, and as he takes your dough
He tells you
""Yes, we have no bananas
We have-a no bananas today
We've string beans, and onions
Cabbageses, and scallions
And all sorts of fruit and say
We have an old fashioned to-mah-to
A Long Island po-tah-to
But yes, we have no bananas
We have no bananas today.""
Business got so good for him that he wrote home today
""Send me Pete and Nick and Jim; I need help right away.""
When he got them in the store, there was fun, you bet
Someone asked for ""sparrow grass"" and then the whole quartet
All answered
""Yes, we have no bananas
We have-a no bananas today
Just try those coconuts
Those walnuts and doughnuts
There ain't many nuts like they
We'll sell you two kinds of red herring
Dark brown, and ball-bearing
But yes, we have no bananas
We have no bananas today.""
Yes, we are very sorry to inform you
That we are entirely out of the fruit in question
The afore-mentioned vegetable
Bearing the cognomen ""Banana""
We might induce you to accept a substitute less desirable
But that is not the policy at this internationally famous green
Grocery
I should say not. No no no no no no no
But may we suggest that you sample our five o'clock tea
Which we feel certain will tempt your pallet?
However we regret that after a diligent search
Of the premises
By our entire staff
We can positively affirm without fear of contradiction
That our raspberries are delicious; really delicious
Very delicious
But we have no bananas today
Yes, we gotta no banana
No banana
We gotta no banana today
I sella you no banana
Hey, Marianna, you gotta no banana?
Why this man, he no believe-a what I say

Envisioning the hereafter, listening to Steve Wonder
On a quest for love like the Proceed drummer
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and chief weed from her
It's a cold world and niggas need summer
At times my going forward seems like retreat
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seen and contagious
Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit I can't honor
It ain't that you selling, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform live-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could have sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key 20
Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollering at the brothers, either you gon' be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land
I can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked with him
This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming
I said it's here, it's here...",relaxed_atmospheric,4

Right about now, N.W.A court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?
[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold
and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished,
bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in L.A.
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?
[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (*Gunshots*)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say

Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck—

*Knocking*
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open now (
Aww, shit
)
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest (*Battering ram*)
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em! (Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?
[Verse 3: Eazy-E &
MC Ren
]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(
Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool
)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say
[Chorus]
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police
(The verdict)
[Skit 3: Dr. Dre,
Cop

The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here! (

You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton

Yo, Ren! (
What's up?
)
Tell 'em where you from!
[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
[Interlude 2: Dr. Dre]
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming
[Verse 3: Eazy E]
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless
, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton

I opened up the door and then I walked into the bar
Through the smoky
dim-lit
haze, I saw him from afar
Moved a little closer just to get a better view
He looked at me, smiled, and said, ""I'm the one for you""

We've heard one too many overused pick-up lines
Give us some credit, we're not sleazy, dumb, or blind
[Verse 2]
Saw another guy right then, his suit was tailor-made
Unfortunately, so were his lines much to my dismay
Thought he had me pegged, tried to impress me with his cash
""You'd look great on my yacht,"" was the best line that he had

[Verse 3]
Over in the corner I saw this one all alone
Looked like Mr. Natural, the kind you would take home
Not like any of the others I've just seen tonight
At least until he opened his mouth, ""Hey babe, what's your sign?""

We've heard one too many overused pick-up lines
Give us some credit, we're not sleazy, dumb, or blind

""The other ones are complete bullshit""

Got fed up, decided to leave after one last drink
Felt a tap on my shoulder and started to think
I can't take this anymore, what will this line be?
That's when he let his line fly, ""Hi, my name is Steve""

And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?

There's no hiding place

It's written on your face and it reads
""Broken spirit, lost and confused

But don't look around for me, child

But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came
[Verse 3: Drake]
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
Twenty-three and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

You fuckin' groupie
Pick up the goddamn phone
[Verse 1]
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday? With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?
You went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You wanna loose two legs?
You tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you,
you say
""Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?"" —
Well, screw you
And I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth—Dre, Drake, Lupe—oohm, touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one true-blue ace
But you ain't and I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo, you make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late, go smurf yourself
You make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over, but they let me go, 'cause I told 'em
I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on!
'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say, ""he-art""
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts
and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you a-are?
Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I lo-lo-lo-lo… lesbian!
Aaahhh! I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, my life'd be so much better if you just—

You'd love me

Now I never
Wanted someone to die
So bad in my fuckin' life

And I'ma have a whale of a time
Bein' a single sailor for the night, bitch, on a scale of
One to ten,
shit, I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches,
ho, I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (De La)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-made
For me, say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched,
yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void,

I avoid Cupid, stupid!

She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out,

And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just
Drop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes

These children of the undead look
Dressed for the endless Halloweens

Takes total dedication
Of black clothes and pale complexions
Rock jet black hair to match their makeup
And who can blame them?
They walk through asphalt cemeteries
Zombie fashions-
They must have been born that way
So can you hear me?
Can you get hip to what I'm saying?
These fashion zombies don’t walk this world alone
So lock those doors and windows
They crawl the malls to shop
For tight black jeans and spiky belts
And scissors for the Zelda cut
And there is no explanation
These creatures are just victims
Dressed in expensive fashions
To look like they crawled out of coffins
And who can blame them?

To accessorize their black zipper hood
And monster children with monster faces
Are looking for love in all the wrong places

Sitting at the light, she pulled up on my right
Looking in the mirror making sure her shit was tight
I know she felt me watching but was scared to look my way
I know she wants to look, but I think I got her shook
Under pressure, don't know what to do
She's got two cuties with her and I got my peoples too
She put it in one, stepped on the gun, and made a U
Looked inside, gave me a smile, then she blew
What am I gonna do

Tell me which way did she go
Pretty young thing in a GS4
Love was so bangin had me open from the door
Tell me have you seen her? yeah

Shining brighter than the floss piece around her neck
The girl was so fine I just gotta make her mine
Tell me have you seen her?
Have you seen her?

Its been a while now, and I'm steady on the case
Everyday I'm looking for her face
It's like a dream to me, and I gotta make it real
Gotta let her know just how I feel
Now there she goes again, driving by
I hit my horn she throws her beams on high
I put my joint in gear and I tried to give chase
She disappears again without a trace
Tell me have you seen her?

Ah hell, I even fucked with different races
A white dude, his name was John
He had a
""Queen Bee Rules""
tattoo on his arm
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian
He didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark 'til the mornin'
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs
Baby, oh, yes oh!

Alright nigga, that's enough
Stop, look and listen, get back to your position

Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street
, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery list
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolate
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors

Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation
[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There will be nobody home
[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to
(Fly to... fly to... fly to...)
[Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone
(""Surprise, surprise, surprise..."")
There's still nobody home
[Outro: Roger Waters]
I've got a pair of Gohil's boots

Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam
Et secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum, dele iniquitatem mean
Amplius lava me ab iniquitate mea: et a peccato meo munda me
Quoniam iniquitatem mean ego cognosco: et peccatum meum contra me est semper
Tibi soli peccavi et malum, coram te feci: ut justificeris in sermonibus tuis, et vincas cum judicaris
Ecce enim in iniquitatibus conceptus sum : et in peccatis concepit me mater mea
Ecce enim veritatem dilexisti : incerta et occula sapientiae tuae manifestasti mihi
Asperges me hyssopo, et mundabor : lavabis me, et super nivem dealbabor
Auditui meo dabis gaudium et laetitiam, et exsultabunt ossa humiliata
Averte faciem tuam a peccatis meis : et omnes iniquitates meas dele
Cor mundum crea in me, Deus : et spiritum rectum innova in visceribus meis
Ne projicias me a facie tua : et spiritum sanctum tuum ne auferas a me
Redde mihi laetitiam salutaris tui : et spiritu principali confirma me
Docebo iniquos vias tuas : et impii ad te convertentur
Libera me de sanguinibus, Deus, Deus salutis meae : et exsultabit lingua mea justitiam tuam
Domine, labia mea aperies : et os meum annuntiabit laudem tuam
Quoniam si voluisses sacrificium, dedissem utique : holocaustis non dedectaberis
Sacrificium Deo spiritus contribulatus : cor contritum et humiliatum, Deus, non despicies
Benigne fac, Domine, in bona voluntate tua Sion : ut ædificentur muri Jerusalem
Tunc acceptabis sacrificium justitiae, oblationes et holocausta: tunc imponent super altare tuum vitulos
[English]
Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness
In your great tenderness wipe away my faults;
Wash me clean of my guilt, purify me from my sin
For I am well aware of my faults, I have my sin constantly in mind
Having sinned against none other than you, having done what you regard as wrong. You are just when you pass sentence on me, blameless when you give judgment
You know I was born guilty, a sinner from the moment of conception
Yet, since you love sincerity of heart, teach me the secrets of wisdom
Purify me with hyssop until I am clean; wash me until I am whiter than snow
Instill some joy and gladness into me, let the bones you have crushed rejoice again
Hide your face from my sins, wipe out all my guilt
God, create a clean heart in me, put into me a new and constant spirit
Do not banish me from your presence, do not deprive me of your holy spirit
Be my saviour again, renew my joy, keep my spirit steady and willing;
And I shall teach transgressors the way to you, and to you the sinners will return
Save me from death, God my saviour, and my tongue will acclaim your righteousness;
Lord, open my lips, and my mouoth will speak out your praise
Sacrifice gives you no pleasure, were I to offer holocaust, you would not have it
My sacrifice is this broken spirit, you will not scorn this crushed and broken heart
Show your favour graciously to Zion, rebuild the walls of Jerusalem
Then there will be proper sacrifice to please you - holocaust and whole oblation - and young bulls to be offered on your altar",relaxed_atmospheric,2

Check it, I used to be the goofy man you hounded
The Special Ed kid at lunchtime
The bitches wouldn't stand around with
I would jack off so much back at my parents' house
And now my dick has a permanent imprint
Of my hand around it
Life was lame, I had to pay money to fuck a whore
I couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tug o' war
But then I made enough money for me to fund a tour
Now the ladies show me the goodies under their wonderbra
I'm goin' door to door, with foreign swords
Causin' more than war
Slayin' rappers, commercial or horrorcore
So, hold your head, 'cause I'ma torture yours
Leavin' morbid sores
I promise you it will be hard to ignore the gore
Hip-hop's dead, and I'm the lucky savior
I'm kinda mad and I don't wanna pile up the anger
All these no-flow, gimmicky-ass, fired-up behaviors
With wack beats and gap teeth like Tyler, The Creator
Motherfucker, you not dope
So you tryna get some attention by cussin'
And eatin' a fuckin' cockroach?
In ""Goblin""? You get no props on it
It sucks so much I get blowjobs from it
I been told you niggas, ""I'm real!""
If you wack and no one's confronted you
On your bullshit, then I will
Hate on me, but you can't deny skill
I crush all the momentum that you guys build
With my eyes sealed
You faggots got me cussin'
And only reason you probably buzzin'
Is 'cause you slave as an Illuminati puppet
Y'all really on one, beat it, you're gone, done
You think real niggas feelin' your shit? C'mon, son!
I'm the illest and that's fo' shizzle
My flow sizzles, your boy Hop go hard like some cold nipples
You niggas are makin' it so simple
My swag makes the ladies wave
Like fat stomachs with bold ripples
I know you niggas wish you could prevent it, 'cause I get buck like my Kool Aid's got way too much sugar in it
You better run like I'm booger-flickin'
Homie, I've been good at rappin'
Now I'm tryin' to get gooder with it
So I'ma just go beast, and bring that West Coast heat
'Cause I'll be damned if you flex on me
The radio is filled with garbage over techno beats
And all these songs about cash are what we just don't need
Yo, nobody care about how much money you stack
I murder everything I touch, buddy, move back!
Got enough guts to sew trash and bust up your fluke act
And leave your fans sayin', ""How the fuck does he do that?""
My rankin' is vicious, you thinkin' it isn't?
Come pay me a visit if you feel that you may be offended
Baby, I'm wicked, crazy and sick
And with the face of a nimwit
I be callin' out names, but I ain't takin' attendance
Some bitch was like…
[""Some Bitch"" (Hopsin)]
""Hop, you got me cryin'
'Cause you said I could call you
While you out on tour, shit, and I be tryin'
I even text you, but you not replyin'
So when your new shit finally drop
That's one album I will not be buyin'
What, you're too Hollywood?
And you don't even have two minutes?
Ever since you got your buzz
You don't know how bad you trippin'
You went to that ho's house last night
And you said that you didn't
I seen your pic on Facebook
The skank bitch done tagged you in it!""

I got put on with the beastie flow
Now the sluts, they wanna bone when they see me, whoa!
So I must, I take 'em home, let the wee wee grow
Then I bust from different strokes, like the TV show
See, when I be comin' through
Kickin' it raw, niggas like, ""Gee, he's dope!""
If there's anyone throwing dirt at my name
Then you know he be toast
For all of you rappers who bringin' me drama
Homie, please be ghost
The only reason I'm bein' aggressive is 'cause we need hope

""Hey yo, Hopsin, I fuckin' love you

And usually I'm not into dark dick

I wanna blow it before you put it in like a Nintendo cartridge""

Hotter than the thought of Nicki Minaj naked
Makin' her booty shake
Hot enough to pull up to yo' show and steal yo' groupie date
Hot enough to melt the ice cream that's on Gucci's face

Than straight on out the door

See I can kinda recall little ways back
Small tryin' to ball; always been black
And my hair I tried it all - I even went flat
Had a gumdee curly top and all that crap, now
Tryin' to be appreciated
Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies
Then I hit by the barber shop real quick
Had em give me little twist and it drove them crazy
And then I couldn't get no job
Cause corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks
T
hen I thought about my dogs on the block
Kinda understand why they chose a steal and rob
Was it the hair that got me this far? (uh-huh)

A saintly trance?
Who would have known
Miraculous breath?
To inhale a beard
Loaded with courage

That a boy like him
Possessed of magical
Sensitivity?
Who would approach a girl like me
Who caresses, cradles his head
In her bosom?

He slides inside
Half awake, half asleep
We faint back
Into sleephood
When I wake up
The second time
In his arms, gorgeousness
He's still inside me

Huh?
Perfect. It’s like, I know, like as far as the length of it and stuff and where you end it, it was exactly perfect
[Verse 1]
And the first one tore a picture
Of a dead and hanging man
Who was kissing foreign fishes
That flew right out from his hands
And when I put my arms around him
I felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
And an eeriness surrounded
When his tongue began to speak
And he said, 'Oh boy you are so pretty
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string'
And when I finally kissed him
The whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over
With two cracks along both sides
And I knew the world was over
So I took a look outside
And watched the fires that were reaching
Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream
They're all waiting here for me
[Verse 2]
Deli markets with their flower stands
And pretty girls and the burning men
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue twice removed from my face
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in a fountain
To save my soul from all these troubled times
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take
To soothe my mind so I'm always sober
Always aching, always heading towards
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country
Finds a nice cliff to drop off
Oh when this life just gets so grating
All the grittiness of life
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you
You're too wonderful to die
[Verse 3]
And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
When all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
And it's a lie that you've been given
That just hurts you every day
So why should I lay here naked
When it's just too far away
From anything we could call loving
Any love worth living for
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
You can sleep here on the floor
And when I wake up in the morning
I won't forget to lock the door
Because with a match that's mean and some gasoline
You won't see me anymore",sad_melancholic,4

Cough go, drink it's— It's for you!

Arrive in time to catch the late show

Embossed beneath a box, in the closet that's lost

Screaming, ""Jesus, save me""
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
'Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God—it's the same me

'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down

No, I never heard them at all

But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around

You roll out of bed and down on your knees
And for a moment, you can hardly breathe
Wondering, “Was she really here?
Is she standing in my room?”
No she’s not
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
[Verse 2]
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
She takes you in, with her crying eyes
Then, all at once, you have to say goodbye
Wondering, “could you stay my love?
Will you wake up by my side?”
No she can’t
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
[Bridge]
Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my, roses in my hands?
And would you get them if I did?
No you won’t
‘Cause you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried, but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for
[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
I know…
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
I know there's too much at stake
Making the same mistakes
And I still don't know why it's happening
Stop while it's not too late
And I still don't know…
[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinkin' in black and white
Thinkin' it's worth the fight
Soon I'll be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for
[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
So how do I know I've gone too far?
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
[Bridge]
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
Feel like a brand-new person
I finally know what it's like
Stop thinking that the only option was…
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
And I know it's hard to describe
Stop thinking that the only option was…

Made me cry

Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

And I was at your feet

Black water, there were six of us, but
now we are five
We're all talking to keep the conversation alive
There was a senator from Ecuador
Who talked about a meteor
That crashed on a hill in the south of Peru
And was found by a conquistador
Who took it to the emperor
And he passed it on to a Turkish guru
[Verse 3]
His daughter was slated for becoming divine
He taught her, he taught her how to split and define
But if you study the logistics
And heuristics of the mystics
You will find that their minds rarely move in a line
So, it's much more realistic
To abandon such ballistics
And resign to be trapped on a leaf in the vine

Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene

He creeps up from behind

Outlining white sidewalks with halogen
Oh have you ever felt so goddamn strong
How come it takes some people so damn long
He tried to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
The citrus drawing out the seasons stains
Watch the basin drain
As your life lines wane
And you can't explain
As your friends complain
You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your whole families name
Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know were feeling
Higher and higher and higher
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
Mother I can tell what you've been thinking
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
And now I've hit the mark
Staring at the dark
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars
Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know were feeling
Higher and higher and higher
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up and keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher",upbeat_fun,4

Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh, and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage

Sorry I couldn’t be there
I was tied to a rocking chair
I was beat down to a pulp
Rocking back and forth somewhere
If you knew, if you saw
You'd have said it was the final straw
There my life was bound and tethered
On a porch by the shore
But there is no, no, no, no, no
Easy way to tell one so
The things you know
And run, run, run, run, run
When they say they think they know
Exactly so
[Chorus]
It’s not right, it’s not right
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we?
Who are they?
Who says those bastards don’t deserve to pay?
Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers
We don’t stand a chance
So long as they're around you're just another song and dance
It’s not fair (It’s not fair), It’s not fair (It’s not fair)
Still I’m the only one who seems to care
[Verse 2]
It’s funny being funny
Makes you feel like up and running
When your past lingers like rain clouds
Casting shadows below
I could live with so many burdens
I'll take all your hope and yearning
But there's no way I won't take me
For their petty little woes
I used to glow, glow, glow, glow, glow
Once I had a love to show
A love they know
But they’re slow, slow, slow, slow, slow
So slow that they never know
Where I go

Uh, I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean,
I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: ""Nobody's workin' as hard as you""
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — this'll do

Greed
Causing innocent blood to flow
Entire culture, lost in the overthrow
They came to seize and take whatever they please
Then all they gave back was death and disease

Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide

And if not for that white greed, it would've endured

Brutality can never be undone
But the sun is not yet set

And see they're responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide

Ya cram ya culture down my throat
Say I'm inferior when I find it I choke
You fill my mind with a false sense of history
And then you wonder why I have no identity?
Well, I'll strike a match and it'll catch and spread the insight we need

I could be your confidante
Just one of your girlfriends
But I (I) know that's (Know that's) not what you want
If tomorrow the world ends
Why shouldn't we be with the one we really love?
Now tell me, whom have you been dreaming of?
I and I alone
Oh no, oh

Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love, baby, I'll show you mine
I can make it nice and naughty

Excuse me for feeling
This moment is critical
It might be revealing
We could get physical
Oh no

Nothing breaks your stride like what's become

Pile it up so high then paint it red
Confuse the dogs, confuse the dogs
And time, time we lost is resting on the stairs
The window out reveals the cooler air
And so we go, and so we go

I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving

I want to hold her hand
Show her some beauty, before this damage is done

Then send me a son

In the parking lot i'm still waiting

So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass

When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big
That I didn't see any chance because
I was living in a little town;
was studying
And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician
I thought, ""Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance""
Because all I really wanted to do is music
And not only play music, but compose music
At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques
So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque
Sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about seven, eight songs
I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about
Almost two years to survive in the beginning
I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s
The sounds of the '60s,
of the '70s
And then have a sound of the future
And I said, ""Wait a second, I know the synthesizer
Why don't I use the synthesizer which
is
the sound of the future?""
And I didn't have any idea what to do
But I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on
the 24-track
Which then was synced to the Moog Modular
I knew that could be a sound of the future
But I didn't realize how much the impact would be
My name is Giovanni Giorgio
But everybody calls me Giorgio
[Interlude]
[Spoken Word: Giorgio Moroder]
Once you free your mind about a concept of
Harmony and of music being ""correct""
You can do whatever you want
So, nobody told me what to do
And there was no preconception of what to do",upbeat_fun,4

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (
C-Candy on the ground
)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (
Dum-da-dee-da
)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (
Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da
)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (
Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
(
Dum-da-de-da
)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (
Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da
)

Shut down MOVE—by police state
Forty-five police storm Powelton Village
Government-sanctioned rape and pillage
Friendly fire kills officer dead
The MOVE nine are framed up instead

(One) unjust system is yet undone
In spite of efforts dissipated
Until the movement was incinerated

May 13th—'85
Eleven people—burned alive
They dropped the bomb after liquid was doused
To smoke out the family and burn up the house
Sights trained on exits, the police wait

MOVE fought against exploitation
The state's injustice and their oppression
For these crimes that the city pigs created

I keep coming back to you

For you not to leave me now (Let's go!)

Not to make you my wifey
Man, they was putting you down (Hey!)
And now they see we rollin'
Me and you, we strollin'

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins

So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care

Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you

So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love

I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself

Up to my knees now
Do I wade? Do I dive?
The sea has seen my like before
Though it's my first and perhaps last time
Let's call me a baptist
Call this a drowning of the past
She is there on the shoreline
Throwing stones at my back

And the land is a marker line

Adrift in water, salt and sky

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn
[Verse 1]
And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah

So tonight, I'm gonna cut it out and then restart

It's always darkest before the dawn (Shake him off)

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't

He came dancing across the water
With his galleons and guns
Looking for the new world
And that palace in the sun

On the shore lay Montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls, he often wandered
With the secrets of the world
[Verse 3]
And his subjects gathered 'round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colors
For the angry gods to see

And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on

But they died along the way
And they built up with their bare hands

And she loves me to this day

Or how I lost my way

From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets

When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

Its so cold I'm about to die
Chasing a dream around the world

Though it use to make me high
Looking for answers searching for the truth
In an ocean of lies
Trying to find a reason to make the whole thing right
Will make you old before your time
When I was younger
I thought I ruled the world
It was an oyster at my feet
Dancing to my own drum
Fishing out the pearl
Wish I would have been much more discreet
I've lived a lifetime
Acting out apart
Its been a long uphill climb
Now all the things that use to mean so much to me
Has made me old before my time

Would it ever be much different now
Remind me of the past
I slip into a dream
Funny things ain't never what they seem

Living like children
Never doing what we are told
Would not hesitate to take a chance
That road behind me now was paved with fool's gold
Its almost time for the victory dance
No more feeling guilty
For things I never did
Feeling nothing for my crime
Living like a gypsy
Dreaming like a kid

Fuck your flag and fuck your face
You're the garbage of the human race
Ever since I was just seventeen
I pledged to kill your American Dream
Singing songs about your war and hate
And how your sickly system alienates
Your corrupt machine destroys the land
Your gluttonous greed, I'll never understand, no!

Jail-fillers: Your time is up!

Corrupt politicians, we're on a mission
A declaration of your abolition
Your petty laws and plans for absolute power
Will rot out from beneath your feet, you're fuckin' sour
As you lock up, destroy our family and friends
Your head'll be on the chopping block before we end
So, put up your nose and wave off your hand
'Cause your grisly torture and death is being planned, go!

[""Jello Rant"": Jello Biafra]
The new world order reeks of dying empire odor
And changing the channel won't make that go away
As the veneer of democracy fades away
As the world's downsized until it explodes
As the shantytowns piled behind the malls become visible
As the savages on the other side of the wall break through
As everybody from gun-crazy militias to anti-immigrant Nazis
To fundamentalist, child-raping Christians to gangsta rappers
To community activists to working families
Just struggling to put food on the table
All mad at the same thing: Your SUV; ""me, me, me""
""Mission Accomplished""; bring 'em on
""Buy more stuff, buy more stuff""
""Fight terror, defend freedom so you can buy more stuff""
The false illusion of the world is going down, motherfucker
Walk off the job, crime is beautiful
(Your time is up!)
A prank a day keeps the dog leash away
(Your time is up!)
Quit your jobs, burn down the malls, aah!

From the sight of you hanging

Off the arm of yet another visionary

You did, I just tried to
Separate an ocean from these tears we cried

You wanna stay warm and get out of the cold with me

It makes a man feel good, baby
Tell me you depend on it, I need to hear it

Baby, you're the perfect weight
Treat me like my birthday

Tell me you don't want me to stop (

Tell me it would break your heart
But you love me and all my dirty

You wanna make fires and get Norwegian wood with me

To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
[Breakdown]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
[Chorus]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know

I said in the main time inbetween I'm on my duty
Sometimes I get beat up, sometimes I'm the beater
Sometimes man my feet hurt from walkin' so long
Sometimes I'm defeated, sometimes I get cheated
Sometimes I just need it, 'cause sometimes I'm wrong
So the question's repeated, why even try?
When there's rocks in the road, pot-holes in the lawn
The victory's sweeter when obstacles either
Are side-stepped or crushed on the way to the door
So I go on my own, have faith in the road
I can share that control cause I'm never alone
I hear the creator speak to me through wispers
On winds the voices of friends and of foes
I listen to omens, the things that he shows me
Shows that he knows me and helps me along
And follow him closely, where he goes mostly
Guidin' my path on this map 'till I'm gone

To rest in my Earthly grave
And when they lay me down
Navigate that big sky wave
But in the meantime I, I got my duty
In the meantime inbetween time I, I got to do this
In the meantime inbetween time I, I'm pushin through this
In the meantime inbetween time I, I got my duty

Here comes the thunder down under, we’re natural wonders
Night falls when we leave all you feel is the hunger
Surprises people of all shapes and sizes
Dig on the decade and realize it’s all funky
No matter this rude boy still got that swagger
My ears have heard all these crews but we’re badder
Interracial, special, positive beings
I am I be a cool awakening
It’s gettin hectic the metrics t
he body electric
Everybody in worn out blue jeans or tacky dresses
This is the city we’ve reached we’ve come to
Go unrecognized on the corner or make moves
All the lights are red all the poets dead
A familiar nightmare appears in my head
Times are changin’ myself I’m rearrangin’
Dream eight-thousand-five-twelve blazin’

I’m not from philly but some say I’m blunt
That’s just the way I am and I’m not going to front
And yes I took a trip to find out about the ways of big
City seedy bars and drugs that make you feel shitty
Pretty older women in skirts conversation frisky
Stinking cigarettes and plenty of bourbon whiskey
Sad classic music on the jukebox of doom
Hollywood boulevard, barfly frolic room
Tomb of lost souls some beyond salvage
Some just having fun opening steam valvage
I was one becoming the other hell bent to discover
Had to pull up the reigns or else smother
Take it brother all the way and then you’re scared, don’t want to be unprepared
You’re getting paranoid and then guns are shared
You guys think that you’re hard
But you’re in fear of being harmed
I fear no man and I’m unarmed

[Verso 1]
Yo pienso que
No son tan inútiles las noches que te di
Te marchas y qué
Yo no intento discutírtelo, lo sabes y lo sé
Al menos quédate sólo esta noche
Prometo no tocarte, estás segura
Hay veces que me voy sintiendo solo
Porque conozco esa sonrisa tan definitiva
Tu sonrisa que a mí mismo
Me abrió tu paraíso
[Verso 2]
Se dice que con cada hombre
Hay una como tú
Pero mi sitio luego
Lo ocuparás con alguno
Igual que yo o mejor, lo dudo
¿Por qué esta vez agachas la mirada?
Me pides que sigamos siendo amigos
Amigos para qué, maldita sea
A un amigo lo perdono, pero a ti te amo
Pueden parecer banales
Mis instintos naturales
[Coro]
Hay una cosa que yo no te he dicho aún
Que mis problemas sabes que se llaman Tú
Sólo por eso tú me ves hacerme el duro
Para sentirme un poquito más seguro
Y si no quieres ni decir en qué he fallado
Recuerda que también a ti te he perdonado
Y en cambio tú dices ""Lo siento, no te quiero""
Y te me vas con esta historia entre tus dedos
[Verso 3]
¿Qué vas a hacer?
Busca una excusa y luego márchate
Porque de mí no debieras preocuparte
No debes provocarme
Que yo te escribiré un par de canciones
Tratando de ocultar mis emociones
Pensando, pero poco en las palabras
Te hablaré de la sonrisa tan definitiva
Tu sonrisa que a mí mismo me abrió tu paraíso

Take me down six underground
The ground beneath your feet
Laid out low, nothing to go
Nowhere a way to meet

I've got a head full of drought down here
So far off losing out round here
Overground, watch this space

Calm me down, bring it 'round
Too way high off your street
I can see like nothing else
In me you're better than I wanna be

Don't think 'cause I'm talking we're friends

Talk me down, safe and sound
Too strung up to sleep
Wear me out, scream and shout
Swear my time's never cheap

I fake my life like I've lived too much
I take whatever you're given, not enough

I spy with the corner of my little eye
Something beginning with ""S""
[Verse 1]
On candy-stripe legs the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realise with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight
[Verse 2]
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight
[Bridge]
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering, furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the spiderman is always hungry

She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm

You charmed the lifeguard

I dug you so much, I took some for the team

What will people say?
Why not everyday, are you so afraid?
What will people say after Halloween?

Because your role is planned for you
There's nothing you can do
But stop and think it through
But what will the boss say to you?
And what will your girlfriend say to you?
And the people out on the street, they might glare at you
And what do you know, you're pretty self-conscious too
So you run back and stuff yourselves in rigid business costumes
Only at night to score is your leather uniform exhumed
Why don't you take your social regulations, shove 'em up your ass?

You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
Gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
Got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right, without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun,
but you believe at heart everyone's a killer

Verse 1: Kanye West
]
I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, ""What kind of doctor can we fly in?""
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
""Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?"" But still–

They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now, she 'sleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus, my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Klaye and Aunt Jean
So many aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just ""1 Thing""
When they said that she made it, you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'Cause with my family, we know where home is
So instead of sending flowers, we the roses

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada,
and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed,
plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

Children,
Broadripple
is burning
And the girls are getting sick
Of huffing glue up in the bathroom
While their boyfriends pick up chicks
And darling, I'm lost
I heard you whispering that night in Fountain Square
The trash-filled streets made me wish
We were headed home
[Verse 2]
And there was love inside the basement
Where that woman used to lie
In a sleeping bag we shared
Upon the floor most every night
And darling, I'm drunk
And everything that I have loved has turned to stone
So pack your bags
And come back home
[Chorus]
And I'm wasted, you can taste it
Don't look at me that way
'Cause I'll be hanging from a rope
I will haunt you like a ghost
[Verse 3]
And if my woman was a fire
She'd burn out before I wake
And be replaced by pints of whiskey
Cigarettes and outer space
Then somebody moves
And everything you thought you had has gone to shit
But we've got a lot
Don't ever forget that
[Verse 4]
And I wrote this on an airplane
Where the people looked like eggs
And when a woman that you loved is gone
She's bombing east Japan
Don't fucking move
'Cause everything you think you have will go to shit
But we've got a lot
Don't you dare forget that

And I'm wasted, you can taste it
Don't look at me that way
'Cause I'll be hanging from a rope

Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it

Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder

I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle

If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
She left here last early Spring, is livin' there, I hear
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so
[Verse 2]
We had a falling out, like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart
[Verse 3]
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
Always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay
[Verse 4]
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft

It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing

Amélie
lied to me, this was supposed to be easy
I found the one damn person to help me fall asleep in the night
But sleeping gets tiring,
and dark reminds me of dying
And as long as this feeble heart is still beating
You will find me rushing through every room, switching on all the lights
The problem with falling in love in late night bars
Is that there's always more nights, there's always more bars
The problem with showing your lover your scars
Is that everybody's lover is covered in scars

So give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up every—

Things got fractious, and I felt faithless
At that moment just before the dawn when everything falls apart
But baby, I didn't mean it, for things to get desperate
I let slip my guard, I let go of the rudder
Now we're drifting in the current away from one another
[Chorus]
Give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up everything
Give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing

[Outro]
And I've been skirting round the rim
Of doing something brave
And not just standing, but jumping in
Of making circles into squares
Of laying down the bare facts
Like a burden I can't bear
And I can almost find the words
But I can see the way you'd
Fold your hands, speak my name like a curse upon your pretty lips
The pressured white behind your fingertips
And when you see me for all that I am
I couldn't make mistakes to make a difference any more
I'd throw myself down on my knees, at your hands
And beg you for forgiveness for my fuckups and my faults
And maybe you'd relent and return my hope for our forever
Lift up your precious hands, and then bring yours and mine together
So give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
Just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather",relaxed_atmospheric,2

Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive
Down the block and you look outside

They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
See if you fuck, then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress livin' in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first: Cali
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

Wake up in the morning with a head like, ""What ya done?""
This used to be the life, but I don't need another one
You like cuttin' up and carryin' on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up gettin' down?
[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You'd better move when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like the magic's only ours tonight
[Chorus]
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you
[Verse 2]
Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colours it'd make a blind man so confused
So why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I'd lose?
[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around, I'm sure that I'll be fine
[Chorus]
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway

I don't feel like dancin', dancin'

Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer lights

Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say
[Chorus]
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
[Verse 2]
Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say
[Chorus]
My love, take my breath away
[Bridge]
Through the hourglass, I saw you
In time, you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today, I'm unafraid
[Chorus]
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
[Verse 3]
Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

Reckless and weary
The truth has been buried
Held down by the hand
That refuses to carry
The burden you built
The lies, do you hear me?
The insult, the white flag

And all that you showed me
I'm letting you know
That you don't control me

And life is unfolding
Reckless and weary

I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man

You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo? Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question, why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...

Alright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot, no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay?
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something? What, you munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
""Yes, I do, sir, what am I on?"" You, sir, are on truth serum
""Marshall, I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities""

[Verse 3]
Alright, now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How 'bout now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why are you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...
[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot

Would you care to come down for fireworks time

This is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping, dying, but somehow still alive
This is the final stand of all I am

When you're out, tell your lucky one
To know that you'll leave
Don't you lock when you're fleeing
I'd like not to hear keys
Only hold till your coffee warms
But don't hurry and speed
Once a time, put a tongue
In your ear on the beach
And you clutched clicking heels

Walking with no shoes or socks
And the time rewinds to the end of May
I wish we'd never met, then met today
I'm working on my faults and cracks
Filling in the blanks and gaps
And when I write them out they don't make sense
I need you to pencil in the rest
I'm working on drawing a straight line
And I'll draw until I get one right
It's bold and dark girl, can't you see
I done drawn a line between you and me
I'm working on erasing you
Just don't have the proper tools
I get hammered, forget that you exist
There's no way I'm forgetting this
I'm working hard on walking out
Shoes keep sticking to the ground
My clothes won't let me close the door
These trousers seem to love your floor
I been working on my backwards walk
There's nowhere else for me to go
Except back to you just one last time
Say yes before I change my mind
Say yes before I...

You turn me off at the push of a button
And you pretend that I don't mean nothing
I'm not a saint, that's easy to tell
But guess what, honey, you ain't no angel
You like to scream, use words as a weapon
Well, go ahead, take your best shot, woman
I want to leave you, it's easy to see
But guess what, honey, it's not that easy

We get so complicated (complicated!)
This finger's for our memories

So rip my pictures from your wall
Tear them down and burn them all
Light the fire, walk away
There's nothing left to say so
Take the ashes from the floor
Bury them to just make sure
That nothing more is left of me
Just bittersweet memories
Memories
[Verse 2]
I want to run and escape from your prison
But when I leave I feel something is missing
I'm not afraid, that's easy to tell
This can't be heaven, it feels like I'm in hell
You're like a drug that I can't stop taking
I want more and I can't stop craving
I still want you, it's easy to see
But guess what, honey, you're not that good for me

So I'm gonna let it do all the talking

I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree

I felt a little fear upon my back
I said, ""Don't look back, just keep on walking""

Well, the big black horse said, ""Look this way""
He said, ""Hey lil' lady, will you marry me?""

And my heart had a problem in the early hours
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two
(Woohoo, woohoo)
But I cut some cord and I shouldn't have done it
And it won't forgive me after all these years
(Woohoo, woohoo)
So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
(Woohoo, woohoo)
Now it won't come back cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see, yeah
