I was as pure as a river
But now I think I'm possessed
You put a fever inside me
And I've been cold since you left
I've got a boyfriend now and he's made of gold
And you've got your own mistakes in a bed at home
I'm hoping you could save me now, but you break and fold
You've got a fire inside, but your heart's so cold

And I've tried to wash you away, but you just won't leave
So won't you take a breath and dive in deep?
'Cause I came here so you'd come for me

You look so defeated, lying there in your new twin sized bed
With a single pillow underneath your single head

Was more space than you would need
Now it's in the alley behind your apartment
With a sign that says ""It's free""

But I hope you have more luck with this than me

You used to think that someone would come along
And lay beside you in a space that they belong
But the other side of the mattress and box springs stayed like new
What's the point of holding onto what never gets used?

And if our love is so wrong, what should we do alone?
Or am I just a picture in a photograph?
Why are we stuck in this pantomime, fearing a god who died?
One who would not deny lovers?
And I don't care what they say, if what you need is your faith
Then take a look at my face and know...
That till your rapture falls to pieces
Until your rapture falls to pieces
Find in me the room to breathe, simple things like suffering
Life had gone this way...
Life is gone this way...
Still in the life of the wrong we all moved along
Another life evolved to gestation
And so we made our way with the mistake we made
But she was just a picture in the photograph
So she walked in the baby's room
Knowing what she should do leaves me in absolute horror
She put her hand on its lips, she gave it one last kiss
And sang some tune that went...
Until your rapture falls to pieces
'Till your rapture falls to pieces
Find in me the room to breathe
Simple things are suffering
And I would and I would, destroy your god
Yes I would if I could destroy your god
Because you're born again
Until you're worn again
Until your rapture falls to pieces
Till your rapture falls to pieces
Find in me the room to breathe
Sinful things are suffering
Till your rapture falls to pieces
Till your rapture falls to pieces
But, if this must be, then burn with me
Anything
Just don't leave...
Find in me...room to breathe...enmity...suffering...
She swore she heard the voice of Jesus
Telling her it was wrong to keep it
And one more thing, it looked like me
Back when it breathed...rest in peace
Until the rapture comes to meet us",intense_aggressive,1

And you're a classic

If you wanna dance just tell me where and when

You're kissing me
And saying I'm the one you need
To keep you warm
And lay with you tonight
Baby I feel the same way
I don't want to leave
Wanna hold you close
And feel your love inside
But I don't wanna play myself
'Cause I know you're with someone else
And I don't need complications in my life
And I don't wanna fall back in
And get caught up in you again
Boy I'm so conflicted in my mind

Just let me rock you
Till the morning light
It's cold outside
And much too late to drive
You know I need you baby

Obviously, procrastinating just to be
Close to you a little longer now
It's hard for me
To break away from you baby
Never could resist you
And I still haven't learned how
And I don't wanna be a fool
But it's hard when it comes to you
And I'm feeling vulnerable tonight
'Cause I don't wanna miss the chance
Of reliving our sweet romance
Boy, I'm so confused down deep inside

Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinking of
But how we move from A to B
It can't be up to me 'cause you don't know
Eye to eye, thigh to thigh, I let go
[Chorus]
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me
[Verse 2]
And for you, I keep my legs apart
And forget about my tainted heart
And I will never ever be the first to say it
But still I, you know I
I would do it
Push a button, pull the trigger, climb a mountain, jump off a cliff
'Cause you know baby, I love you, love you a little bit
You would do it, you would say it
You would mean it and we could do it
It was you and I, not only I

I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit

But only if you're a little bit, little bit

How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

I asked somebody 'Could you send my letter away'?
'You are too young to put all of your hopes
In just one envelope'
I said goodbye to someone that I love
It's not just me, I tell you it's the both of us
And it was hard
Like coming off the pills that you take to stay happy
Someone above has seen me do alright
Someone above is looking with a tender eye
Upon your face, you may think you're alone
But you may think again
[Chorus]
If I could do just one near-perfect thing, I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts, I'd rather hang around
And be there with my best friend
If she wants me
And far away, somebody read the letter
He condescends to read the words I wrote about him
And if he smiles, it's no more than a genius deserves
For all your curious nerve and your passion
I'm going deaf, you're growing melancholy
Things fall apart, I don't know why we bother at all
But life is good and 'It's always worth living
At least for a while'
[Chorus]
If I could do just one near-perfect thing, I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts, I'd rather hang around
And be there with my best friend
If she wants me
If you think to yourself 'What should I do now'?
Then take a baton, girl, you better run with it
'Cause there is no point in standing in the past
'Cause it's over and done
I took a book and went into the forest
I climbed the hill, I wanted to look down on you
But all I saw was twenty miles of wilderness
So I went home
[Chorus]
If I could do just one near-perfect thing, I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts, I'd rather hang around

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
[Verse 1]
Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

Come my lady, you're my pretty baby

[Verse 2]
I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
[Verse 3]
Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

A different beat, yeah
A brand new song

Let the gospel truth reach every distant plain;
Let the tidings roll that every guilty captive
May be fully free and help to praise His name

You ain't gonna walk free boy

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest
and
I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (You ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn)
and the heroin
Where were the parents at? (Parents at?) And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin')
then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way)
but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am
[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label,
let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be Black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it)
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am
(Way I am)

Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?

I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit

You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit

If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human permanently!
But, if he doesn't, you turn back into a mermaid
and... you belong to me!

[ARIEL, spoken]
If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
[URSULA, spoken]
That's right! But, you'll have, your man. Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? Oh! And there is, one...more...thing! We haven't discussed the subject of payment
[ARIEL, spoken]
But I don't have any—
[URSULA, spoken]
I'm not asking much. Just a token, really, a trifle. You'll never even miss it. What I want from you is... your voice
[ARIEL, spoken]
My voice?
[URSULA, spoken]
You've got it, sweet cakes. No more talking, singing, zip!

But without my voice, how can I—
[URSULA, spoken]
You'll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha!

The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yes, on land it's much preferred
For ladies not to say a word
And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man
Come on, you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead, make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman
And I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad, but true
If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet
You've got to pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll!
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys!
The boss is on a roll!

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans,
hope euphoria can slow dance
With society,
the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine,
we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's,
""Ayy, y'all—duck!""
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin',
the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons
but still'll never know my life

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah

So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball
and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn,
they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes

When you choke on the regrets, yeah
Who the hell did I think I was?

And stranger than your sympathy
And all these thoughts you stole from me
And I'm not sure where I belong
And nowhere's home and I'm all wrong

And I wouldn't be the one to kneel before the dreams I wanted

Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television, and put on the weather
And I've trained myself to give up on the past 'cause
I froze in time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better

While my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines
I was losing my mind because the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away

Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was

Mourn the years before I got carried away

Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet

Were a couple of guys who'd been friends since grade school
One was named Cyrus, and the other was Jeff
And they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom
The best ever death metal band out of Denton
Never settled on a name
But the top three contenders, after weeks of debate
Were ""Satan's Fingers,""
and ""The Killers,""
and ""The Hospital Bombers""
Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed
For stage lights and Lear jets, and fortune and fame
So in script that made prominent use of a pentagram
They stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names
This was how Cyrus got sent to the school
Where they told him he'd never be famous
And this was why Jeff
In the letters he'd write to his friend
Helped develop a plan to get even
When you punish a person for dreaming his dream
Don't expect him to thank or forgive you
The best ever death metal band out of Denton
Will in time both outpace and outlive you

Keep all my secrets in the trinkets dangling from the walls

It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children
[Chorus]
And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love for me
But she still belongs to someone else
[Verse 2]
It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love for me
But she still belongs to someone else

Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22
Either way it went

And what he's probably like 'cause

Get him through the night

Doesn't count 'cause the room is spinning
Nothing to lose tonight they both are winning

Just as long as you break his heart

Put me on the blink
I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again

When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep

He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him

But a fool can have his charms

Lately I've not slept a wink

And worship the trousers that cling to him

Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best
Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Couldn't eat, was dispeptic

I'm footloose in my Velcro shoes
What's up with Will and Grace?
I don't get drum and bass
The future freaks me out.""

I'd rather waste our time together
Yeah, 'cause we can get down
[Verse 2]
Betty can't quit carving question marks in my wrist
How come we're so alone?
We waste away the days with nicotine and television samples
Of an era we hate to admit we embrace
We fail to represent
We fail to be content
We fail at everything we ever even try to attempt
And so the story goes
As only Betty knows
It's time we take control
(Get down)

Check it out, I'm rocking steady

I'd rather waste my time with her

Betty, I need you
I miss you
I'm so alone without you
To call up on the weekends with my cellular phone
[Bridge]
Betty, it's so hard to relate
To the whole human race
I don't know where to begin
I don't know where to begin
If we can both find a way
To do the things that we say
We might not sit in our rooms
And drink our daydreams away
Betty, I'm a dreamer
I'm not a vicious schemer
Oh Betty, won't you- ah fuck it
[Chorus]
I'm on fire... and now I think I'm ready to bust a move
Check it out, I'm rocking steady
To the beat in my head

I'd rather waste our time together

Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speakin' to children
Everything was happenin' so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was gettin' sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin'
but really thinkin': ""If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him.""
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, I'd just zone out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like tellin' Gwen Stefani she sold out
‘Cause I was tryna leave no doubt
In anyone's mind, one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now because everybody knows
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
[Interlude: Eminem]
Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quit actin' salty!
I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history,
well goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhandin' a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck's all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said, ""There ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out!""
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch
Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto
'fore they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado,
so get lost, Waldo
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm takin' no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changin' back into that old maniac
In fact, there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin'
‘Cause everybody knows
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed, ""ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?""
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm makin' up words so you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuck father time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup
Now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I’m goin' back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can’t knock bein' rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows

All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up
To be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn, it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do
[Verse 2]
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado
[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, ""Oh""
[Instumental Break]

It's a switch flipped

Fall asleep while swimmin'

O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""people,"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple, huh
It's sort of like, oh well,
another way to call a cat a kitten
It's
five little letters
that are missing here
You get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?
You get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?
It's not a front
, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)
It's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it
There's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)
[Verse 2: Treach]
Well, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letters the same, but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word rhyming with ""cleanest"" or ""meanest""
I won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly
I'll say the last P, hmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?
And you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away
He had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that
skeleton bone right in the closet door
Now don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.), I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

[Verse 3: Treach]
A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must've been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming, so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you, Treach,"" I said, ""Now, child, please
You gots to leave, come grab your coat right now, you gotta go""
I said, ""
Now look, you choose the stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was O.P.P., hell, from the very start""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting, isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her, for sure, I'm going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it
[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

Album on hold, whole world on hold
The crowd is like, ""HO!"", operator's like, ""Hold"" (""Please hold"")
Man, now ain't that cold
I'm just tryin' to talk to my homie that's up in the hole
And homegirl not tryin' to be a ho, even though she on a pole
Can she get a second chance? No
Whoa, like the opposite of go
That ain't how it's supposed to be or butterfly
But for the sake of rhyming, let's just say butterfly-ee
The truth stings like Muhammad Ali
I tell 'em, tell 'em, don't homicide me
I'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
Fightin' for his fans and fightin' for his folks
But the boos from the crowd can become so loud
If I can block 'em out then, I could knock 'em out and
Dance around the ring but until then I'll sing
[Hook]
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there
Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there
When I get there, whoa, oh
[Verse 2]
Doctor, doctor please, the fame ain't painless enough
""That's cause you ain't famous enough
You got a little game but your name ain't ringin' enough""
He said ""Take two of these, put some change in my cup""
I said I wasn't poor, he gave me some more
Prescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door
Out, ouch
I'm tellin' you this all from a therapist's couch
""Tell me about your mother, what she's all about""
Prescribed me a interview and then told me to bounce
Damn, jeez
The world is so cold, I'm glad I bought these skis
Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees
Rendered unconscious, they rushed me to a concert
Instead of green jello and maybe chicken soup
They fed me magazine covers and video shoots
[Hook]
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there
Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there
When I get there, whoa, oh
[Verse 3]
And when I finally make it, I'ma stunt so hard
Evil as Knievel, I'ma jump so far
Way up in the atmosphere, I ain't comin' back
Be a jerk to them jerks, yeah, that'll make 'em hurt
""Huh?"" said a young boy in the mirror
A young version of me, so I started to tear up
He said ""You need to cheer up, your mind need to clear up
You're already here, just be yourself from here up""
Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar
Somethin' I was taught, somethin' I had lost
If you are afraid or fear that you gon' change some
All you gotta do is just remember where you came from
[Hook]
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be

Playing all innocent and ho'ing since the foundation
Don't make me have to pound his tin crown face in
And risk being jammed up like traffic, inbound from space and
There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put my chips on the worse bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off, ended it and dipped
And if you spoke us off, we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw— no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think, I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power...

Probably kissed me later that evening, I should be hurling
Matter fact, gimme back my bracelet and my Shearling
I rather waste it or give it to your girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was workin'
Remember, our vacation out to Maryland?
I duked the maid Carolyn, she made me throw the towel in
Like all foul men, the time I hit your moms off
I told her knock it off, but she had to set the rocket off
Ain't enough room in this ----ing town
When you see tin head, tell him ""be ducking down""
I'm not rompin' around, he better be

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert

Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins

Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster

My head will burst, my life will end
So I'd like to start this one off by saying ""Live and love""
I was young and at home in bed
And
I was hanging on the words some poem said in '31
I was impressionable, I was upsettable
I tried to make my breathing stop
Or my heartbeat slow
So when my mom and John came in I would be cold
From a bridge on Washington Avenue
The year of 1972, broke my bones and skull
And it was memorable
It was half a second in, I was halfway down
Do you think I wanted to turn back around
and teach a class
Where you kiss the ass that I've exposed to you?
And at the funeral, the university
Cried at three poems they'd present
In place of a broken me
I was breaking in a case of suds at the Brass Rail
A fall-down drunk with his tongue torn out
And his balls removed
And I knew that my last lines were gone
While, stupidly, I lingered on
Oh, but wise men know when it's time to go
And so I should, too
And so I fly into
the brightest winter sun
Of this frozen town
,
I'm stripped down to move on
My friends, I'm gone
Well, I hear my father fall
And I hear my mother call
And I hear the others all whispering, ""Come home""
I'm sorry to go
I loved you all so
But this is the worst trip I've ever been on
So hoist up the John B. sail
See how the mainsail sets
I'm full in my heart and my head
And I want to go home
With a book in my hand
In the way I had planned
Well, this is the worst trip I've ever been on
Hoist up the John B. sail
See how the mainsail sets
I'm full in my heart and my head
And I want to go home
With a book in each hand
In the way I had planned
Well, I feel so broke up, I want to go home",upbeat_fun,4

Sometimes in the morning
I am petrified and can't move
Awake, but cannot open my eyes
And the weight is crushing down
On my lungs, I know I can't breathe
And hope someone will save me this time
And your mother's still calling you insane and high
Swearing it's different this time
And you tell her to give in
To the demons that possess her
And that God never blessed her insides
Then you hang up the phone
And feel badly for upsetting things
Crawl back into bed to dream of a time
When your heart was open wide
And you loved things just because
Like the sick and the dying
[Verse 2]
And sometimes when you're on
You're really fucking on
And your friends, they sing along and they love you
But the lows are so extreme
That the good seems fucking cheap
And it teases you for weeks in its absence
But you'll fight and you'll make it through
You'll fake it if you have to
And you'll show up for work with a smile
And you'll be better and you'll be smarter
And more grown up and a better daughter
Or son, and a real good friend
And you'll be awake, you'll be alert
You'll be positive though it hurts
And you'll laugh and embrace all your friends
You'll be a real good listener
You'll be honest, you'll be brave
You'll be handsome and you'll be beautiful
You'll be happy

Your ship may be coming in
You're weak, but not giving in
To the cries and the wails of the valley below
And your ship may be coming in

This world is yours to discover
With brand new eyes
You're no player in a game of roles assigned
What you possess has no barter, no structure
No insurmountable walls
Only barriers of perception
Don't you ever be afraid of all of your beauty
You can move without his words
Or a grant of submission
Oh they try to smother
Your righteous ambition
And stifle your loving grace
They tell you it's a little girl's place
To alter your convictions
No don't you wait...
Put it down, rhetoric
Shake it out now, honey
They said you want it
They said you need it
But you don't need it anymore
(and you never did)
They thrust you their products
By making you feel insecure
The matriarch was murdered
And now woman is a four letter word
Put a price on your body
To convince you that it's all you're worth
They are afraid of the power they lose
And the gift of creation
So don't you ever listen!",intense_aggressive,1

To the seat with the clearest view

Fights problems with bigger problems
Sees the ocean fall and rise
Counts the waves that somehow didn't hit her

Still prepared for an attack

You're out swimming in the flood
You kept back, you kept unspoken

I was hanging around in my house
I had that old book with pictures of Madonna naked

and I lit his house on fire
He came home on acid, I was holding his shotgun
I was dressed like Tina Turner in
Beyond Thunderdome
He said, ""Don't shoot!"" I said, ""I won't, I love you, you're my friend""
I handed him my wig and shot myself in the head
Then I stuffed a box of tissues in the hole in my skull
I got in my Mazda and I drove to the mall
I bought a Big Johnson shirt
and some silicone tits

And the beer I had for dinner was my crazy neighbor's pills
We had to sit down on skateboards just to make it down the hill
Then I peed my pants
and you stole the groom's cigar
And some old man made me watch him masturbate locked in his car
When I got back to the apartment, you were face-down on the floor
You said ""Don't go to bed yet,
let's go get a sixty-four
""
And the beer I had for breakfast was a pint of Jim Beam
And a fifth of peach Schnapps and some warm Sunny D
And you said, ""Bottoms up!"" just as I bottomed out
And I tried to scream ""Fuck you!"" but blood was pouring out my mouth
And Evan Dando
never planned on telling you the truth
And your Leonardo I.D. card is your fountain of youth
You can be a teenager for your whole fucking life
Just find some pretty sucker and make that bitch your wife
And I guess by now you all know my friend Danny broke his neck
He was driving home from Sirens and he got into a wreck
First I cried for him and then I cried for me
Haunted by the ghost of the girl I used to be
But the rocks with holes are warm in my hands
And I bury my toes in the hot, hot sand
And the silver-pink pony kisses me and

These little volcanoes came as a surprise to me
I never thought I could be this way
And I have been cautious and I've tried to keep to myself, but who could love you the way I do?
[Chorus:]
Now I just want you to know
How I'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you
So much more each day
Baby, if you're still awake
Call me when you get this
Now i just want you to know, how i'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you

About forgetting yourself for a while

And that white dress she's wearing
You haven't seen her for a while
But you know that she's watching
She's laughing
, she's turning
She's holding her tonic like a crux
The room's suddenly spinning
She walks up and asks how you are
So you can smell her perfume
You can see her lying naked in your arms
And so there's a change in your emotions
And all these memories come rushing
Like feral waves to your mind
Of the curl of your bodies like two perfect circles entwined
And you feel hopeless and homeless
And lost in the haze of the wine
Then she leaves with someone you don't know
But she makes sure you saw her
She looks right at you and bolts
As she walks out the door
Your blood boiling, your stomach in ropes
Oh, and your friends say ""What is it?
You look like you've seen a ghost""
Then you walk under the streetlights
And you're too drunk to notice that everyone's staring at you
You just don't care what you look like
The world is falling around you

No matter what you do I don’t react

About the catty rude people that just suck
What do you know all of the sudden, ah I usurp you
Look it up in the dictionary to find out what I do
I go back to the style I came from
It’s not something you can fake son
You’re a con man who’s run is done

[HELPMANN]
Good evening, David
[TV INTERVIEWER]
What do you believe is behind this increase in terrorist bombings?
[HELPMANN]
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people who seems to have forgotten a certain good old-fashioned virtue and just can't stand seeing the other fella win. If these people would just play the game, they'd get a lot more out of life
[TV INTERVIEWER]
Nevertheless, Mr. Helpmann, there are those who maintain that the Ministry of Information has become too large and unwieldy
[HELPMANN]
David, in every society, information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a bad shot, and the cost of it all is 7% of the gross national product. I understand this concern of the taxpayer. They want value for money. That's why we always insist on the principle of information retrieval charging. It's absolutely right and fair that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detection for the information retrieval procedures used during their interrogation",upbeat_fun,4

As you can see, I took the pill, I took the pill, right to the house
Grabbed a shot of liquor, pop, pop, popped it in my mouth
And I'm thinkin' to my self that this might be a waste of my time
'Cause what if I don't even get high?
Thirty minutes done went by, I didn't even seem high
Until I stood up and looked at the ceilin' for some reason
Now I'm home tweakin', then I tried to walk but I was slow
I guess I'm floatin' in ecstasy (just like the nigga told me)
[Chorus 2: Krayzie Bone & Flesh Bone]

And I'm pokin' in somethin', oh, damn, but it ain't no joke
Cut guards and red beans
And for them niggas that follow me around for my mojo
Feelin' so see... 'cause I'm floatin' in ecstasy (Alright)
Ahh, my nigga just call up the homey to hook us up on that liquid G
And if these hoes don't wanna see, they gotta check the spot quickly
I'm feelin' my high, but I'm also feelin' way low
But, damn, I'm stuck in between
Fuckin' with broad boys and never get used by choice
Well, hell,
just throw in a few more
Diablos
, nigga, Flesh Bone so chill
I'm feelin' it hump through my body, feelin' hot and exotic
Feelin' knocked out, feelin' too sexy for my motherFUCKin' self!

Who's my niggas tell me the level?
I started to see the devil, nigga was floatin' in ecstasy
Shit, I took the pill, couldn't feel nothin' so I'm breakin'
But about thirty more minutes later, nigga was on the couch fainted
Arms sweaty, man, why in the fuck y'all let me do this?
I'm lookin' at my homegirl like I want her, nigga, this some new shit
I realized, nigga took one step and started stumblin'
And I was tryin' to call my nigga but he couldn't hear me, so I guess I'm mumblin'
Fall off into somethin', but I guess I'm on a mission
Tellin' my niggas that I love 'em now but it ain't nobody listenin'
Whistlin', hangin' out the window, need me some indo
Till I let go, like, me silky fine-ine, ine
Flown the expo, knock, knock, knock at the door
But nigga was paranoid, so I grabbed my gun and bucked it at the door
Ooh-wee, shit happens, my family got me faded
But I'm runnin' a secret cous', 'cause a nigga can't take it
Shake it if I can but I blend in with the killers
And I wish E was here to feel pillish, pillish, pillish
[Chorus 3: Wish Bone]
I feel so violent, violent fuckin' with that ecstasy
Come roll with me
I feel so violent, violent fuckin' with that ecstasy
I feel so violent, violent fuckin' with that ecstasy
Come roll with me
I feel so violent, violent fuckin' with that ecstasy
[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
I've been smokin' weed for a very long time, why should I change?
And plus they say that ecstasy shit fucks up the brain, brain
Ah, why should I? Just to get high? When weed gets me high, when weed gets me high
""Nigga try this here,"" they said, ""better then that there""

We should get jerseys 'cause we make a good team
But yours would look better than mine 'cause you're out of my league
And I know that it's so cliche to tell you that everyday
I spend with you is the new best day of my life
Everyone watching us just turns away with disgust
It's jealousy, they can see that we've got it going on

To let you know you're more to me than what I know how to say

Maybe I'm just lucky 'cause it's hard to believe
Believe that somebody like you'd end up with someone like me

Should I take you home?
I don't mean to keep you waiting
But I just gotta know if you're ready

That you couldn't wait to get me home alone

Got on all my ice, talking cash shit
Been balling all my life, Lamborghini's, fast whips
She down to ride and deserves a boss who down to provide
We run the streets, but on G5's, I'm talking fly
Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, newer rings
You with a big boy, so we do the big things
Had to valet park it, Chanel hoodie on
Looking like Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted
She on my wanted poster
, Ciroc in my mimosa
I'm balling like LeBron, we shopping in Milan
The 458 Ferrari, I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb
The sex is so explosive, her stuff is supersonic
She my new addiction, I swear, I'm through with chronic

Rocking the most ice, I said we the hottest

Can make you feel like no one

When I had to look the other way

The air begins to feel a little thin
As I start the car and then I begin
To add the miles piled up behind me
I barely feel a smile deep inside me

And I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I want to crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart
[Chorus]
For me to drive away with
I began to understand why God died
[Verse 3]
The demon sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark, so he held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night
[Bridge]
And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game
And then I saw him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said, ""I'll take the grave
Please, just send them all my way""
Then I felt chills in my bones

Froze over, when you thought you could hold Yoda
With flows older than the first sold cold soda
Grow more for my bros those rojo soldiers
Them cincos are at it again, blow doja
I am like Iron Mike, back in the day
My rhyming's iron height, defiant flight
Try and bite, like a razor in a candy apple
A taser in a jammy, tackled
By a neighbor with the family shackles
Laboring a man he's gaffled
I get angry, I sip bombs (Chea!) on your rich lawn
I was brought up Muslim and Christian
I been studying Chrislam (Chea!)
That's not a thing so I place this John
In your chicks palm
Give her something beautiful to kiss on
'Til I spit one to her lip balm (Chea!)
I've been rhyming since Reagan in politics
Polished it then got a big wallet where all of my dollars sit
To the wall is split, then I gotta sick the casa, your god exists
'Cause a lot of chicks holler ""Mr. Chopper you're hot as shit""

Uh, yeah, feel like I been here before
Maybe I have but I can't fuck with it
Hit 'em with a semiautomatic, watch 'em duck with it
Speaking on lyrical ability
Everyone in my vicinity, blowing they mind like Kennedy
I got no love for the enemy, somebody tell me the remedy
I'm like what's good, been fine
Tell me what's on your mind, rewind this shit
My message is beyond this shit
I put that on everything, I'm just being honest, shit
So what's up, hold up
Tech, I'm sorry for the hold-up but I been on the road
Should have had this verse to your ass a long time ago
When I put that on everything, I ain't had a minute to myself
But I been living like I ain't finna see tomorrow
I ain't focused on no wealth
I been living good, I been feeling fine
Pass the sriracha, I put that shit on all of mine
Busting like Columbine combined with a terrorist's mind
That's been confined to four walls for some time

There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz,
take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on it's jaws
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lily
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz,
take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz,
this waltz
With it's very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging it's tail in the sea
There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz,
take this waltz
Take this waltz it's been dying for years
There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lilies of snow
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz,
take this waltz
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ...
With its very own breath of brandy and death
Dragging its tail in the sea
And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, Oh my love
Take this waltz,
take this waltz
It's yours now. It's all that there is

I made blinds

Like you do, you voodoo fresh to me
You just wanna be different, get the best of me
Everything's meant to be, you were sent to me
You and me got wild destiny
You're like a little angel won't ever pressure me
E-e-everything you do's so zef to me
I love it that you best friends with me
I just wanna treat your heart carefully
'Cause everyday I feel blessed to be
The one chillin' with you right next to me

Wednesday morning at five o'clock
as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free
[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years
[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, ""Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?""
[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)

This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it, in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it, wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now, I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap
I would say it got me a plaque, but what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home

I know fatality might haunt you

I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded—well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth
I know what I know, and I know it well not to ever forget

I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand-me-down sneakers
Bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy, black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said, ""Kendrick, you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted""
Oh, I forgot, ""Don't Kill My Vibe,"" that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest-in-peace
Then be an advocate, tell your homies, especially
To come back home""

I say, where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is",relaxed_atmospheric,2

I'm crying out but no one hears me -- Disappears in the wind
Hear these voices inside me -- Echoing the soul within

No hope for the future -- When there's no love in sight
Then You -- Came to me -- And You -- Set me free
We walk this path together -- May our aim stay true
Hold on to the passion -- There's only one way to go

Our wide toes plunged into
The weeping shale to tear our
Skin up off from the bottom
Leaves our ankles bare

Some ghastly predicament of mine you'll find
Leaves us plastered to a bed of hairs with
Me all coiled up near the bottom with my chest un-bared

Gather up its harm and gods with grateful arms

Graze it with their wind arrows

This cigarette, it could seduce
A nation with its smoke
Crawling down my tired throat
Scratches part of me that's purring
Softly stirring
I'm a captain of industry, smoking famously
Feet up on the windowsill
Looking at all these trees I feel affinity with
Everything so soft and still
Budding at my fingertips
Touching you, I start to bloom
Alive with trains and passing ships
Soft and sweet along your lips now
I go ""oh wow""

The longest shadows ever cast

And we shed what was left of our summer skin

Even Hell can get comfy once you've settled in
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave
No matter how fucked you get
Sorrow is there when you come back down
Funny thing is, all I ever wanted I already had
There's glimpses of heaven in every day
In the friends I have, the music I make, with the love I feel
I just had to start again
[Verse 1]
The days are a deathwish
A witch-hunt for an exit
I am powerless
The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless
Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die
I can't fear death, no longer, I've died a thousand times
Why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell

Throw me to the flames
Watch me burn
Set my world ablaze
Watch me burn

How are we on a scale of one to ten?
Could you tell me what you see?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?
Have you ever took a blade to your wrists?
Or have you been skipping meals?
We're gonna try something new today
How does that make you feel?

Uh, I'm still trapped inside my head, it kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm livin' paradise, with what I have to worry 'bout?
Dealin' with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Makin' sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
Difference between love and war inform me, I'm above the norm
Give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, bath salts
Rhymin' like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
Still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music 'gainst my life, I think I fear the choice
I don't know what I'm runnin' from, but I'm runnin' still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothin' real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mil wouldn't make me sign a fuckin' deal
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
I want that Rolls-Royce that the homie Lennon drove
(Woo, woo, woo)
So if they don't got some dollars for me, I'ma send 'em home
Unconventional, special, but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds (Centerfolds)
Troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go (Let 'em go)
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow

And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly
Watchin' horror movies with some foreign groupies, thinkin' this decor suits me

I'm in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful (it's blissful)
Lookin' out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet (Finally meet)
I think I'm JFK's final speech (Final speech)
Try assassinatin' all of my beliefs (My beliefs)
I'm asleep, so whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high, some weed to grind on top of Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine (Be divine)
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same (Not the same)
Lookin' out the window, ashin' on the pane (Ashin' on the pane)
I wonder if I lost my way (Lost my way)

Turn your ear to the ground
Show your face to the sky
On a night when the skies echo sounds
From inside of your mind
On the stage that you shone
Where the sun did become you
And move with your thoughts
Through the sighs and the scenes
Of the worlds you have seen
And the sights that have been
Your reflection in shadows and dreams
Your reflection in shadows and dreams?
Did you ever see a man
Who did walk down the street
White robe with no shoes on his feet
And on top of his head place a box with two slits?
And the sign from his neck said
""I do not exist""
Or a woman who could not remember her name
Did stutter and stutter
Again and again
And saw you and called you her son?
Her eyes said
""My being is gone
But still I'm not dead.""

Have you listened to an image?
Have you ever touched a thought?
Have you ever tasted nothing?
Have you ever told a lie

Because truth it had lied
All its life when it spoke to you?
And what did it say?
It is that, it is this
This goes here, here is there
It is not, yes it is
It was dulling your senses
Your eyes they were bound
Have you ever, my friends
Been looking around?
And the other replies
With a wave of a hand:
I am already here
In this promised land
But not by a god and not by a king
And not by a spirit
Deep from within
I am here
Because a miracle's a whim;
It's a flash of glory
It's an empty tin
And maybe might lets you in
Not to save you
But to keep on looking
Oh, miserere, miserere
Miserere, miserere
Miserere me
Oh, miserere, miserere
Oh, miserere, miserere
(repeats under verse)
Have you ever
Been so happy that you're sad?
That the lights turn to stars
And the stars become eyes
And hellos are goodbyes
And the laughs are the sighs
And the show disappears with the note
""Until next time""?

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Yeah
Yeah
Rise
Half-alive and stark-raving free and maligned
For encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption
Due to the prolific nature of this statement
Listener aggression is advised
[Verse 1]
It's strange, whenever I see a gun, I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my fucking mind, yeah it blows my fucking mind
These days, I never seem to get enough, I'm tired of this shit, I wanna go home
Don't waste my fucking time, don't waste my fucking time
Because anything exceptional gets crushed by common people
With jealousy and ignorance and all their common evils
This planet isn't special, collections made of clay
I'm waiting for the punishment, I know it's on my way

Irreverence is my disease
It's secondhand, but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity
[Verse 2]
Somewhere on a toilet wall, I read the words
""You form a line to formalize the former lies,"" and I finally saw the truth
Something so profound, and it was sitting there surrounded by
The garbage and the stains, another victim of the refuse
Now I've been saying this for years, but you don't comprehend it
I fight hell and I fight fear because I understand it
Androgyny and insults, you try so hard to be difficult
You wanna win the war? Know what you're fighting for

Oh, oh
Woman, tell me what you want and I'll calm down
Without bleeding out
With a broken heart that you stabbed for an hour
Woman
I was freaking out because I want you to know
My beloved, you are the lover of
My impossible soul
Woman, too
Promise me you'll stay and put off all your woes
I was wigging out
Too much worry, I could not get you at all
And you said what you want
You would laugh it off, but I know you won't go
Not for real, at last
Must you write it off for the impossible soul?
And I was in a dream
I was gone away without you, but not too slow
Lest I put it off
For I put it right for the impossible soul

Though I know it's small, I want love for us all

To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

You're always there for me, looking good by my side

And then you lose it

Were they as tender

As your strain to try and maintain
Felt the same

It took my days out of place
And integrates and negotiate
A loss of faith

Now I'm surrounded
They saw me fall from here but not hit the ground
And I's been dying
The body found and my soul was left to drown
Suffocated in concrete
It took a hold of me
Put me on repeat
Now your last routine
And you start to leave
Towards an escape
But I feel sustained

As your strain to try and maintain
Felt the same
I'm always to blame
It took my days out of place
And integrates and negotiate

These walls got taller
I start to lose the sense of life
The rubicon's a warning
As I see they're washing away my pride
And in the tide
I saw the crimes I passed them by
I wonder why?
I question why?

There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay

But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim, it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and
throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars—I know it

And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe

They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying
and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

She begs me to come down
Says, ""Boy, quit foolin' around""

Warm sun and wind in my ear

If the meek shall inherit the earth
And not the weak
Let me inherit the street, fuck it
You know what I mean?
I mean I love life man, you know what I mean
Life is beautiful, it's just the shit in it that's fucked up
It's rough but it's fair
People gotta go out there and bust they, bust they ass for a job
I mean, my dad's got five kids, man and I mean yo
He hates drivin' a bus but he loves five kids
You feel me?

I'm a rhyme artist
Out here tryin' to grind my hardest
Up early so to milk the cow
Keep my john deere out here plowin' the fields
To keep my John Hancock's worth up in the now
Went from hangin' on blocks to hangin' on charts
Positions is parta my mission to hangin' on top
Gotta get your polly cracker or with them crackers
And them scheisty ass niggas if you like it or not
I've been rewired to work more efficiently in the dirt
I'm hands on with it all up in my cuticles
Some try to get off the farm but fell into harm
Of gettin in the game of those street pharmaceuticals
But, I was raised in those blue collar themes
Havin' white collar dreams cause I see what it means
And though the meek shall inherit the earth but don't forget
The poor are the ones who inherit the debt
You can bet I got better things to do than that
I was a dick who got jerked by Tom and his boys
Came on my land, seized my cattle, and catalog
As if it wouldn't leave me less than coy
But I'm far from bitter even farther from quittin'
Got a grind date to make, no time for sittin'
And playin' xbox, stand up and exercise my rights
As of by seen of through masta's eye
[Interlude]
It's the grind date
Know what I'm sayin? I'm sick of askin' that
I mean, the street philosophy is that
I'm gonna milk the cow and cook the meat
The grind date
At least I'm gonna have some kind of food and drink
Because sometimes you can't come back
Like momma said that if you need 5 cents don't ask for 3
Ask for 10, that's for sure
[Verse 2: Dave]
Yo fuck a rhyme artist, I ain't here for that
I was born with the boom bap, respect the name
My hands on experience was hands on my first contract
Taught me quick how to respect the game
Introduced to the block, got used to the block
But your neighbors be the ones who throw shit on your lawn
It's like every single time we pop, they got annoyed
But we got ahead, and we got along
And puttin' work on the calendars, worse on them calendars
Worth of hump days that broke the camel's back
The grind'll make today look gray
And paint a tainted picture of tomorrows in enamel black
Meet the rhyme, street grind, son whatever the beast
I'm a take it at the horns till the pinky toe torn
And show you why we here this long
Cause when it comes to puttin' in work
Once again it's on
[Outro]
I'm just like everybody else man
An average nigga with above average potential
You know what I mean? I'm not sayin' that I'm a gentleman
I'm sayin that I know how to act like a gentleman
In order to get the things that I need
And if I gotta pull out my nickle bag, I'm gonna do that
This ain't no accident, we stayin' here
You damn right I am proud of myself man
And I'm proud of my team man
I don't want you to get the wrong, yo baby on the real?
I don't have sex with people that I do business with neither
And that's the real
But I do do business with people that I have sex with
So if there ain't no conflict, let's get this grind on

A city freeze, get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper
A city drought, you're down and out
See your trousers don't taper
Saddle up, kick your feet
Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again

And at the chime of a city clock
Put up your roadblock
Hang on to your crown
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armour down
[Verse 2]
Stay indoors, beneath the floors
Talk with neighbours only
The games you play make people say
You're either weird or lonely
A city star won't shine too far
On account of the way you are
And the beads around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place

And at the beat of a city drum
See how your friends come
In twos, or threes, or more
For the sound of a busy place
Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for

Without a face to hide in
And he will lose if he won't choose
The one he may confide in

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard about the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range

Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side

Get the lowdown son
We’re mashin and bashin

I bet we get the people jumpin overseas

You come from the suburbs
Just like me
But I could never despair
Most people in this world
Ain’t got shit to spare
Suckas look up to thugs
They like the attitude
But fuck that
I’m talkin’ gratitude
They harder they act
Just to hide their insecurity
I’m talking honestly

Dope, I smoke it
But not everyday
Cuz anything all the time’s

I don't want to feel you die
But if that's the way that God has planned you
I'll put pennies on your eyes
And it will go away
See?
You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming
Steven.... Is someone calling me? No....
Steven....
I think I hear a voice--- it's outside the door!

I hear my name!

With vision not so blinding yet
Anger, just one chance that we get

With the blood on the nightsticks, a new mark is made
The terror evaporates
Oh, in the rain
In the rain coming down on a new day
Dust to dust, a violation of trust, justice
That maybe somebody someday will understand
We didn't live and die in vain
The voices of the people will come down like rain
Like rain
Like rain
We're like rain
We're like rain
And though there's blood on the nightsticks, it's never too late
The streets are burning bright in the light of the flames
Of the flames
New suns for a new day
Broken faces, plastic nerves
Selling the passion to rot in the suburbs
Plastic faces, broken nerves
Selling the passion, we rot in the suburbs

From action to fashion, we rot in the office

From action to fashion, we rot in the office
Rot in the office
Rot in the office

And I was still asleep
